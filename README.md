# Speech Analysis for Parkinson's Disease Using GMVAE

This repository contains a series of Python scripts implementing Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders (GMVAE) for speech feature analysis in Parkinson's Disease (PD) research. These scripts focus on different aspects of speech analysis, ranging from unsupervised learning to supervised approaches emphasizing latent space distinctions.

## Overview

The project includes the following key scripts:

1. **Unsupervised GMVAE (SThVAE):** Focuses on analyzing speech features of healthy individuals and evaluating latent space distances to Parkinsonian patients.
2. **Supervised GMVAE with Manner Class Distinction:** A supervised variant of GMVAE, maximizing distances between clusters in the latent space for different manner classes (split between Parkinsonian and healthy classes).

Each script is designed to process speech data, train the GMVAE model, and analyze the results, providing insights into the potential indicators of Parkinson's Disease in speech patterns.

## Installation

## Installation

To set up the project using Conda, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

# Create a Conda environment from the .yml file
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate the Conda environment
conda activate your-env-name
```

## Usage

Each script can be run independently, depending on the specific analysis you wish to perform. Here are the general steps to follow:

1. **Prepare Your Data:** Ensure your speech data is correctly formatted and stored in the required directories.
2. **Configure Hyperparameters:** Adjust the hyperparameters in each script according to your data and analysis needs.
3. **Run the Script:** Execute the script using a Python interpreter. For example:

   ```bash
   python SThVAE_unsupervised.py --fold 0 --gpu 1
   python SThVAE_supervised.py --fold 0 --gpu 1
   python SThVAE_classifier.py --fold 0 --gpu 1
   ```

4. **Analyze Results:** Check the output files and visualizations generated by the scripts for analysis.

Detailed usage for each script is documented within the script files themselves.

In case you want to train all folds, you can use __run_parallel.sh__ bash script.
