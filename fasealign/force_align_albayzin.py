"""
Author: Alejandro Guerrero-LÃ³pez

This Python script is designed for extracting text from TextGrid files (manual segmented from Albayzin dataset), generating a final dataset
of pairs containing .txt and .wav files, and performing forced alignment using the FaseAlign tool.
The primary goal is to streamline the process of preparing and aligning audio and transcription data
for further linguistic analysis and research.

The script consists of three main functions:

1. extract_text_from_textgrids: Extracts text from TextGrid files and saves them as .txt files.
2. generate_final_dataset: Organizes pairs of .txt and .wav files and copies them to a new directory.
3. forced_alignment: Performs forced alignment on the pairs using the FaseAlign tool.

For more information on how to use this script and the FaseAlign tool, please refer to the respective function
documentation and the FaseAlign documentation: https://fasealign.readthedocs.io/en/latest/aligning.html
